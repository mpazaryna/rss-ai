OpenAI has developed a new series of reasoning models called OpenAI o1, which are designed to spend more time thinking before responding to complex tasks in science, coding, and math. The first model in this series, o1-preview, has shown significant advancements in solving challenging problems and adhering to safety and alignment guidelines. The o1-mini model has also been released, offering a faster and cheaper option for developers. These models are available in ChatGPT for ChatGPT Plus and Team users, with plans to expand access to all ChatGPT Free users in the future. OpenAI is working on adding more features and developing additional models in the GPT series and OpenAI o1 series.
