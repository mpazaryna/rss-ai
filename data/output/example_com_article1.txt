OpenAI has introduced a new series of AI reasoning models called OpenAI o1 that can solve complex problems in science, coding, and math by spending more time thinking before responding. The first model in this series, o1-preview, outperforms previous models in challenging tasks and has undergone safety training to adhere to guidelines. These models may be beneficial for researchers, physicists, developers, and other professionals working on complex problems. Additionally, OpenAI has released a faster, cheaper version of the o1 model called o1-mini, which is particularly effective for coding tasks. Users can access these models through ChatGPT Plus and Team, with plans to make o1-mini available to all ChatGPT Free users. Future updates will include additional features and the development of new models in the GPT series and OpenAI o1 series.
