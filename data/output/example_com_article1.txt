OpenAI has developed a new series of reasoning models called OpenAI o1, which are designed to spend more time thinking before responding and are able to solve harder problems in science, coding, and math. The first model in this series, o1-preview, has been released in ChatGPT and their API, with regular updates and improvements expected. These models have been trained to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize mistakes. In tests, the reasoning model in the o1 series has performed similarly to PhD students in challenging tasks in various subjects. The article also discusses safety measures implemented to ensure the models adhere to safety and alignment guidelines. OpenAI o1-mini is also introduced as a faster and cheaper model specifically effective at coding. Users will be able to access these models in ChatGPT, with plans to add more features and continue developing models in the GPT series and OpenAI o1 series.
