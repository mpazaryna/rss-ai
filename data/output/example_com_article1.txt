OpenAI has developed a new series of AI reasoning models, called OpenAI o1, which are designed to spend more time thinking through complex tasks before responding. The first model in this series, o1-preview, has shown significant advancements in tasks such as physics, chemistry, biology, math, and coding. These models have also undergone rigorous safety training to ensure adherence to safety and alignment guidelines. OpenAI is collaborating with AI Safety Institutes in the U.S. and U.K. to further enhance AI safety. The o1 series is particularly useful for those working on complex problems in science, coding, math, and similar fields. In addition to o1-preview, OpenAI has also released a faster and cheaper model, o1-mini, which is effective for coding tasks. Users can access these models in ChatGPT, with plans to add more features in the future and continue developing models in the GPT series as well.
