OpenAI has developed a new series of AI models called OpenAI o1, which are designed to spend more time thinking through complex problems before responding. The o1 models have been trained to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize mistakes. These models perform well on challenging benchmark tasks in fields like physics, chemistry, biology, math, and coding. OpenAI has also implemented a new safety training approach to ensure that the models adhere to safety and alignment guidelines. The o1 series is particularly useful for tackling complex problems in science, coding, math, and similar fields. Additionally, OpenAI is releasing a more cost-effective, faster model called OpenAI o1-mini that is effective at coding. Access to these models is available for ChatGPT Plus and Team users, with plans to make o1-mini accessible to all ChatGPT Free users. OpenAI plans to continue developing and releasing models in the o1 series, as well as the GPT series.
