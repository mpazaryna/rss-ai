OpenAI has introduced a new series of reasoning models called OpenAI o1, designed to spend more time thinking before responding and solving harder problems in science, coding, and math. The first model in this series, o1-preview, has been released in ChatGPT and the API, with regular updates and improvements expected. This new series represents a significant advancement in AI capability for complex reasoning tasks. Safety measures have been implemented in the development of these models, including a new safety training approach and collaborations with AI Safety Institutes. The o1 series may be useful for tackling complex problems in various fields such as healthcare research, physics, and development. A smaller, more cost-effective model called OpenAI o1-mini has also been released for coding tasks. Users with ChatGPT Plus and Team subscriptions can access the o1 models, with plans to make o1-mini accessible to all ChatGPT Free users in the future. Additional features such as browsing, file and image uploading are in development for these models, and OpenAI plans to continue developing and releasing models in both the GPT series and the new o1 series.
